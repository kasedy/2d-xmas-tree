# 2d-xmas-Tree-art
a DIY flat christmas decoration with a ATtiny25, 20 ledÂ´s and a coin cell battery 

## Differencies from the original project
- Converted to [PlatformIo](https://platformio.org/) project
- More convinient for building and setting fuses
- Added animation compressing script
- Significantly reduced memory footprint
- More default animations
- Reduced power consumption

## Overview

![Image from the 2D xmas tree](https://github.com/designer2k2/2d-xmas-tree/raw/master/img/2dxmastree_gif.gif)

This is a only 2 dimensional pcb with all the components embedded into the 1,6mm thick pcb itself.
The components are placed with the help of castellation into the pcb.

All files including the Code for the ATtiny and the KiCad Files for the PCB are here, OSHW!

# PCB

The PCB design is made with KiCad 5.0.1

The PCB should be 1,6mm thick to hide the components inside. last time I ordered them from [DirtyPCbs](https://dirtypcbs.com/) as suggesed [@designer2k2](https://github.com/designer2k2). They handle castellation but you still need to clean metal contacts from bended metalization debris. Next time going to order with [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) as I like more their bright solder mask color. To order PCB use prepared gerber archive [2D_xmas_tree01_gerber_complete.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasedy/2d-xmas-tree-art/master/pcb-kicad/gerb/2D_xmas_tree01_gerber_complete.zip)

Most of the PCB is to give it the look of a tree or house, it uses the different color achievable by blending the different layers. Here is a good article on possible colors: https://hackaday.com/2018/06/11/ask-hackaday-what-color-are-your-pcbs/

## Create your own animation!
