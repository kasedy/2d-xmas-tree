# Take following steps:
# 1. Connect ISP
# 2. Set Fuses
# 3. Upload

# 1MHz configuration consumes around 700uA. I uses internal 8MHz 
# oscillator as a system clock source with 8x prescaler. 

# SLOW_CPU configuration uses WatchDog 128Mhz low power oscillator
# as a system clock source. It allows to decrease microcontroller 
# power consumption 5 times (up to 140uA).

# WARNING: for successfull upload "SLOW_CPU" target your programmer
# must support "slow sck" mode.
